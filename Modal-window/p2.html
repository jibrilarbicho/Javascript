        Gada is a traditional system of governance used by the Oromo people in
        Ethiopia developed from knowledge gained by community experience over
        generations. The system regulates political, economic, social and
        religious activities of the community dealing with issues such as
        conflict resolution, reparation and protecting womenâ€™s rights. It serves
        as a mechanism for enforcing moral conduct, building social cohesion,
        and expressing forms of community culture. Gada is organized into five
        classes with one of these functioning as the ruling class consisting of
        a chairperson, officials and an assembly. Each class progresses through
        a series of grades before it can function in authority with the
        leadership changing on a rotational basis every eight years.
